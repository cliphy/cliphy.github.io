The highly interdisciplinary and highly collaborative EU-funded project DISTENDER aims 
to develop a robust decision support system for climate change mitigation and adaptation 
for European regions and metropolitan areas. 
This week the project website went online: <https://distender.eu>

Our role in the project is to provide 
climate information and our main tool within the project is the regional climate model ICON-CLM in km-scale resolution. 
The Fig. shows, as an example, the ICON-CLM simulated T2m (Â°C) for the very hot summer day 26 June 2019. (MK,BA)
