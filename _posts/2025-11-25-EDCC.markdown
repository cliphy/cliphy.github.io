“Mountains share many characteristics with Arctic regions and are experiencing similarly rapid changes,” said Dr. Pepin from the University of Portsmouth’s Institute of the Earth and Environment and lead author of a new review on elevation-dependent climate change in mountain environments published today in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment by [Pepin et al. (2025)](https://rdcu.be/eRBHC){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
